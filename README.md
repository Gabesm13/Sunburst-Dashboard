# Sunburst Dashboard (Python + Plotly)

Generates an interactive HTML dashboard with a 6-level sunburst of user/navigation paths, a table of the path breakdown, and a horizontal bar chart of path counts. No server required â€” the result is a single HTML file.

**Tech:** Python 3.10+, Pandas, Plotly
